#I added the google font cdn to the header section of the index.html page

#For the retina screen, I added the "srcset" attribute to pull the image

#I used font awesome for the hamburger menu and search icon (added the cdn to the header and pulled the icon to the approriate place) 
but for the shopping cart, I used the icon available in the image folder

#due to the time given, I wasn't able to complete the functionality for the expanded menu, I the issue am having is if I should use jquary or if its a bootstrap option. 
"data-target" is a bootstrap attribute. I wouldn't want to waste too uch time on it.
    $(document).ready(function(){
    $("expander").click(function(){
        $("expander__toggle");
    });
});. I believe this code is suppose to  but somehow its not. Am missing something for sure 

#I was able to use javascript query seletor and setInterval function  to add two more slides , I was able to add some "overflow-hidden" style to the images 
which helps with the reponsiveness.

#I was able to add the social media icon and set it "inline block" style to make it align straight infront of each other

#I was able to remove the horizontal scrol bar menu by adding "overflow:hidden to the html and body tag styling "

#was able to collapse the expanded footer menu, using media quary at max- wedth 768px.

General oversight
I love  the simplicity of the design, the background and the responsiveness. FED did a good job with where he left off but I think some of this could be improve upon
    *Good and consistent indentations
    *There was a ittle bit of deep nexting that got me kind of confusing
    *Fed did a good job with  naming of the divs and classes but at some point I felt there are repetition 
    * I love simplicity, this code can be made much more simpler that it is.
The more I work on the project the more I would be able to find more ways to improve, there is always room to be better.
